# Z-Boson-Data-Analysis

Given 2 data files, I had to write a script that would remove outliers, validate the files and make them useable for plotting. Used array mesh to find the 2 coefficients of a function and their outliers. Code should be functional for most data sets given. 

End goal:

Create a useful plot that displays all the necessarry information about the data sets.
